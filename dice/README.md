Dice
====

This package provides a simple way of generating various multisided dice.
It accepts a slice of strings with each string with dice roll expressions.
Dice expressions are formed by the number of dice, a dice description, and
a simple arithmatic express of any modifiers.  Dice descriptions begin with
the letter "d" followed (without a space) by an integer (e.g. "d4", "d6",
"d8").
